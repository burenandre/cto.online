# [1131] CTO Types

No matter what type of company you work for, being a successful CTO requires a combination of technical expertise, leadership skills, and the ability to think strategically. There are different types of companies that you (might) find yourself working for:

### Pre-startup CTO

You are CTO in name only. In this type of company, the CTO is responsible for laying the groundwork for the company's technology infrastructure. This includes choosing the right tools and technologies to support the company's goals and vision. A CTO in this role must be able to think strategically and be willing to take risks to help the company succeed.

### Start-up CTO

You are CTO in being the technology expert. In a startup, the CTO is often the first technical hire and is responsible for building the company's technology from the ground up. This includes everything from choosing the right programming languages and frameworks to building a team of developers. A CTO in this role must be a true technology expert and be able to lead and inspire a team.

### Scale-up CTO

In scaling up a high potential startup, the CTO must be able to navigate the company's existing technology infrastructure while also bringing new ideas and innovations to the table.  This requires strong leadership skills and the ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

For these reason initial (start-up) CTO's are often being replaced by external new ones with more integral business competences, like myself.

### Enterprise CTO

When stepping into an existing CTO's role for an established corporation, a new CTO must be able to understand the company's existing technology infrastructure and be able to build upon it. This requires a deep understanding of the company's goals and vision, as well as the ability to lead and inspire a team at (large) scale.
