# [1232] Transformation Office

Establishing a Transformation Office (TO) offers several benefits, including program consistency, a source of momentum, impact assessment, a coordination mechanism, a development resource, and a guarantor of executional certainty.

As a digital strategy consultant, it brings me great joy to help organizations transform and achieve their goals. The initial period of any transformation program is crucial to its success. It is during this time that the transformation office (TO) is organized, and its influence starts to take shape. The businesses and leaders involved in the transformation learn about the processes they need to follow and offer input on how to fine-tune those processes.

To ensure that the transformation program is successful, it is essential to align everyone on one way of doing things. This includes using the same process, accessing the same tools, and following the same cadence for reporting and meetings.

Five dimensions are essential here to be included and addressed effectively in the transformation program:

### Objective & Scope

It all starts with a big ambition, which is then translated into prioritized initiatives. Big ambitions fuel transformations and keep them on track. The company must decide what the baseline is and use that baseline to establish clear financial goals. This is an essential aspect of anchoring the transformation and allowing accurate measurement of value capture.

### Governance & Organization

Having committed to a suitable ambition, strategy, and scope, the company should start to define the transformation office's governance and organization. Decision rights about strategic direction and objectives belong to the CEO, while the CFO owns the financial goals. The CTO has decision rights over the company's scarce resources, coaching responsibility, and the power to hold others accountable.

### Activities & Processes

The transformation office needs to be resourced, which means making decisions about staff size and skill sets. It is crucial to implement common working rhythms, routines, and processes. This may seem obvious, but the devil is in the details, and devoting attention to this issue is of great tactical importance.

### Tools & Data

The fifth dimension of a successful TO involves the use of software and online tools to help with the job. These are, in essence, tracking tools that link initiatives to financial outcomes (plans and forecasts) and impact assessments.
