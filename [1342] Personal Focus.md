# [1342] Personal Focus

As a CTO, you are no stranger to the demands of work. The fast-paced nature of the industry can be all-consuming, leaving little room for anything else. But it's important to remember that work is not everything. To truly succeed in life, you need to prioritize what matters most.

Take a step back and think about what is truly important to you. Is it your family, your friends, your health, or your personal growth? Whatever it may be, make sure it takes center stage in your life. Ring fence time for the people and things that matter most to you. No matter how busy you are, never lose focus on carving out quality time with those you love and who love you.

But don't forget about yourself. It's equally important to take time for yourself. Carve out sufficient "me" time and give yourself space away from the demands of work. Choose one day per week to turn off electronic devices and go cold 'tech' turkey. This will give you the chance to recharge your batteries and come back to work feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

Work can become all-consuming if you let it. But with discipline and dedication, you can create sufficient time and space for quality time away from work. So prioritize what matters most, make time for your loved ones, take time for yourself, and recharge your batteries. You'll be amazed at how much more fulfilling your life can be.
