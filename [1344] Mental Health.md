# [1344] Mental Health

Just like your physical mental health requires ongoing awareness, attention and maintenance. When you are mentally strong, you will be your best Self (with capital S). You then have the courage to do what’s right, and develop a genuine comfort with who you are and what you are capable of achieving.

Mentally strong people don’t feel the world owes them anything, and they don’t expect immediate results. Everyone wants justice and their fair share in life, but the belief that you are owed something because of what you’ve been through or because you are an exception to the rule is unhealthy.

Progress isn’t always obvious, and change isn’t often immediate; they are gradual processes. Sometimes, it is not about the time you put in but the amount of work you do to achieve your goal. We have to accept that we can’t get everything instantly. The quick fix is not always the best solution, and expecting quick fixes is setting yourself up for failure and blinding yourself to newer opportunities. The saying "patience is a virtue" might be old and cliche but is nothing short of the truth.

Realize there will be bad days but don’t let them put you off. Take the bad days in stride with the good days and strive to lessen the bad days. Leave room for improvements and remember to learn from problems and 'failures', rather than allowing them to knock you off course. Maintain a healthy behavior until it becomes part of you and nothing short of second nature. If you succeed in this, let me know how you did it.

### Your Team

Managing team dynamics is not just about understanding the technicalities of the job, but also about recognizing the human element that is integral to any team.

As a leader, it is your responsibility to foster an environment that promotes open communication and empathy. By recognizing the signs of burnout and distraction, you can proactively address any issues affecting your team's performance and well-being.

In these unprecedented times, where remote work has become the norm, it's more important than ever to prioritize the pastoral care of your team. By creating a culture of compassion and understanding, you can help your team navigate the challenges of working in a pandemic and emerge stronger on the other side.
