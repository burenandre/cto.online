# [1233] Transformation Meetings

Frequent discussion with owners of each work streams about the status of their initiatives, projects, and milestones are crucial. Don't wait until the end of the transformation to see whether your initiatives will meet their goals. Instead, engage the workstream owners to continually update their forecasts on value delivery. This creates opportunities for agile problem-solving and for pivoting to maintain momentum and reach key targets.

A transformation process is often intense. It isn't business as usual, and it shouldn't feel like business as usual. The level of transparency, accountability, and cross-functional cooperation that transformations require is higher than the level at which organizations function naturally. At least initially, the program should make the people involved feel a little uncomfortable to warm up their change muscles.

Project owners and milestone owners need to know that you're counting on them to make progress every day. They should also know at the end of one week's meeting what they need to achieve before the next week's meeting. Use the meetings to identify and remove roadblocks. This often requires decisions and follow-up actions by higher-level executives. Transformations often "flip the pyramid," forcing executives to solve problems for people one, two, or three levels below them.

### Collaboration

By focusing on cross-department problem solving, you can help different functions understand the benefits of collaboration. This not only increases trust but also allows the CTO to emerge as a leader of the organization. By maintaining a bias toward working sessions, you can reduce the feeling of being overburdened with meetings. By emphasizing the centralized data system, you can ensure that the centerpiece of most meetings is the status of milestones and other important data.

### Tracking Progress

it's important to remember that not everything can be done equally well in a transformation and to keep focussing on a small subset of initiatives that senior leaders see as make or break, and ensure they are executed flawlessly.

To reduce the number of missed targets during the transformation, a good Transformation Office (TO) creates processes that identify issues early, flags the most important issues up the leadership chain, and forces stakeholders to resolve issues quickly. The TO pays special attention to critical projects that are off track and deals with interdependency failure points. It helps reprioritize projects when disruptions occur, ensuring that the transformation stays on track.

### Accomplishments

By setting aside time for encouragement, you can create a more personal interaction and recognize key accomplishments. Celebrating small successes can inspire people and keep them motivated. Finally, by having the right tools to support the process, you can ensure that people can access information in real-time. The most important tool is software for tracking each workstream's initiatives and projects and for creating a portfolio view.
