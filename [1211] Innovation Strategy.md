# [1211] Innovation Strategy

Your vision is not just a project; it's a journey that requires long-term planning, commitment, and consideration.

### Timing

Timing in this is everything. Remembering this when embarking on large-scale projects such as transformation projects is crucial. By breaking down your vision into smaller, manageable projects, you can create a plan that is palatable to the business and achievable over time.

### Progression

Consider is the tolerance for the company to wait for your vision to be realized. Break down your vision into bite-size chunks that the business can feast on and feel a sense of progress. When they can see benefits from your vision early and often, their appetite to continue to support and fund you will not diminish.

The weakest position you can find yourself in is one where the project feels like it's getting larger, taking longer, with the release date getting further and further in the future. Keep the business's confidence by delivering results and keeping them engaged in the process.

### Buy In

To ensure the success of your project, you must be conscious of how the business will react and how strong their appetite is to support you. You need to think like the business and identify what they need to be convinced of before signing off.
