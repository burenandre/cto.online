Being a cheerleader means putting your team first. It means listening to their ideas, acknowledging their hard work, and providing support when necessary. It also means letting go of your ego and allowing others to take credit for their ideas. Remember, you are there to support the team and build a strong foundation for the company to grow and thrive.

Your personality type may be driven by generating ideas, but it's important to recognize that others on your team have valuable insights and expertise to offer. By allowing them to shine, you are creating a collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute their best ideas.

As a cheerleader, you have the power to inspire and motivate your team to achieve greatness. Encourage them to keep going, acknowledge their great ideas, and be positive in all situations. Even when you have to shoot down an idea, do it in a way that makes the other person feel heard and valued.
