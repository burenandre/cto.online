# [1251] CTO vs CFO

As a CTO you understand the importance of having a holistic view of your department's operations, including its financial aspect. And while it may seem daunting, I am confident that with the right mindset and tools, you can make informed decisions that will benefit your company in the long run. By understanding your department's financials, you can show the value that your team provides to the company. Every dollar you ask for should be justified by the return it will bring to the company.

To achieve this, you need to build a good working relationship with your CFO. The CFO is responsible for reporting all numbers to the CEO, board, and government. By understanding what the CFO needs, you can align your department's budget with their wants and needs, making their job easier. When they can count on and trust your budgets, you will have a stronger partnership that benefits both your department and the company as a whole.

Your CFO should be there to help you succeed. By working together to track your expenditures and identify any areas where you may be overspending or double-counting expenses, you can ensure that your department is operating efficiently and effectively. And by demonstrating your reliability and trustworthiness when it comes to managing your finances, you'll be in a much better position to secure the budget approvals you need to continue driving innovation and growth.

Don't let yourself be caught off guard by unexpected costs or surprises. Take the time to get a firm grasp on your department's finances and work closely with your CFO to ensure that you're always on top of your spending. With a little bit of effort and a lot of determination, you can become a true leader in your organization and take your team to new heights of success.

Remember, taking control of your department's financials is not just the CFO's job. It is your duty as CTO to be aware of your department's costs and expenditure. By doing so, you can make better-informed decisions that will benefit your department and the company in the long run.
