# [1263] Board Participation

Here is some general guidance to help you in your board participation as CTO:

- Know the agenda of the meeting, and understand the overall message your CEO is trying to convey.
- Do not disagree or correct your fellow executive team members if this is not your area. Make a note of it, and follow up afterward. There may be a context you are missing.
- Keep your presentation on point and focused. Find ways to explain complicated initiatives in a way your listeners can relate to.
- Don’t be intimidated into making any rash decisions. Take their question, and commit to following up with an answer within a couple of days.
- If reporting bad news, never blame, disparage, or name anyone.
- Be prepared to go into detail and field questions that may come out of left field and not feel on point. You may not be aware of what else has been discussed.
- Do not take your laptop, or use it sparingly if you have to give a demo, closing the lid as soon as you are done. Hiding behind a laptop, pretending to take notes, looks like you are disengaged. Take notes the good old-fashioned way, with a pen and paper, to show you are engaged.
- If you are not involved in the whole board meeting, leave as soon as you are finished and questions have been fielded. Ask the CEO (or chairperson) if it is okay to leave; don’t hang around and be told to leave.
- Be on your guard in the informal meetings. These people are very adept at making you open up and tell them something you probably shouldn’t.
