# [1223] Servant Leadership

Servant Leadership focuses on leaders serving their team members to enable them to reach their full potential. This style emphasizes alignment, autonomy, empowerment, trust, support, accountability, and innovation.

Servant leaders recognize that their role is to serve the needs of their team members, rather than expecting their team members to serve them. They take ownership of the why and what of a project or goal while delegating the how to their team members, providing them with autonomy and allowing them to make decisions closest to the work.

This approach flips the traditional command-and-control leadership model, where employees are disempowered and compliance is emphasized. Instead, servant leaders empower, trust, and support their team members, fostering an environment of experimentation, innovation, and personal growth.

Your job is to balance operational excellence with (free) radical innovation. Create an environment that brings out the best in both the "soldiers" who ensure day-to-day business operations and the "artists" who drive innovation. By bridging the divide and respecting the value that each group brings, leaders can create a dynamic and balanced organization.

Aim to be responsible and empathetic leadership that focuses on creating a positive and empowering work environment, allowing individuals to thrive both professionally and personally. It emphasizes the significance of leaders' actions and their impact on the well-being and success of their team members.

### Leadership Privilege

Always be mindful that leadership is not simply a position of authority but rather a role that requires qualities and behaviors that positively influence and inspire others. Leaders' words and actions have consequences, not only in the workplace but also in the personal lives of their team members. It emphasizes the responsibility leaders have in creating an environment where individuals can thrive and feel safe to express themselves without fear.

Leaders are encouraged to focus on their vision and desired outcomes while inspiring and motivating their team members. The aim is to foster an environment where people feel empowered to contribute and speak up, rather than one where they feel compelled to hide or remain silent.
