# [1235] Listening

Great leadership goes beyond just having technical skills. It requires a certain grace that allows you to hold your thoughts and not always jump in with your opinions.

The ability to listen and understand is a crucial soft skill that every leader should possess. It is understandable that some may feel uncomfortable with silence or not being seen to immediately have the answer, but it is important to recognize that these moments of discomfort can be turned into opportunities to truly listen and understand your team.

Your team looks up to you for guidance and support. By taking the time to listen and understand their perspectives, you will not only become more effective in your role but also foster a culture of trust and respect within your team.
