# [1252] Managing CFO

The secret to a good relationship with your CFO is no surprises. They want predictability and dependability on your numbers, and if you can prove you are someone who can be trusted with your figures, when it comes to budget approval, your life will become so much easier.

So, take the time to get to know your numbers and meet with your CFO periodically to review your expenditure sheet. This will not only help you avoid any surprises but also give you a better understanding of your burn rate.

Don't let yourself down by not having a firm grasp on your costs. With a little information, you can make everything go so much smoother. So, take charge of your finances and let your CFO know that you're someone they can depend on.

The time and effort it takes to service client requests is your window into how you can improve your systems and reduce costs. By having a clear understanding of the costs associated with producing and delivering digital products, you can make informed decisions and have meaningful conversations with your CFO.
