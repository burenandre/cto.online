# [1214] Innovative Culture

Creating an innovation culture for your team can be challenging, but it's worth it. Start by codifying your intent to be innovative and make it clear that experimentation and failure are okay. Encourage brainstorming and dreaming, and allocate time for employees to work on pet projects or participate in hack-a-thons. Remember to measure and track the outcome of innovation to understand how innovative your company is being. By prioritizing innovation and creativity, you'll not only make your company better, but you'll also create a more enjoyable workplace for your employees.

To start, take the time to really understand your company's technology challenges. Talk to other departments, observe processes, and listen to customer complaints. This will help you identify areas that can be automated or improved. Remember, your customers won't always tell you what they need, so it's up to you to anticipate their needs and find ways to better serve them.

Stay on top of the latest technologies and trends. This will help you find new ways to innovate and stay ahead of the competition. And don't forget to take time for yourself. Creativity often comes from mixing disciplines, so make sure to have a balanced life and be aware of what's going on around you.

### Idea Machine

One of the best ways to generate ideas is to keep an (online) notebook to capture ideas. Jot down anything and everything that crosses your mind, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. You'll be amazed at how quickly ideas and thoughts can be lost in a busy day, so it's crucial to keep a record of them. I personally prefer voice and use Siri to capture my best ideas when they arise to be sent to my inbox.

Every idea counts, and it's the small ideas that can often lead to big breakthroughs. So, keep noting things down, and who knows, a big idea might just ferment over time and become the winner. Never stop being curious and never stop generating ideas. The world of digital is constantly evolving, and we need to keep up with the trends and stay ahead of the game.
