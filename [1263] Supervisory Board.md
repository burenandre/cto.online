# [1263] Supervisory Board

As technology becomes increasingly integral to every organization's business strategy, (non)executive leadership boards need to provide stronger guidance on technology governance.

There is a growing trend of board tech committees among Global Fortune 500 companies.

Many boards struggle however with how best to engage with technology and there is often a disconnect between the board and management on major technology initiatives.

Even online companies still have hesitations about creating a more dedicated and specialized tech role and responsibility in the supervisory board or its committees.
