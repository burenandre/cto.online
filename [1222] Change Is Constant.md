# [1222] Change Is Constant

There is a paradigm shift in how businesses approach transformation, emphasizing agility, continuous learning, and short-term value realization.

1. **Declining Executive Tenure:** The tenure of executives is reducing. Coupled with the trend of longer project durations, executives may hesitate to invest in initiatives whose benefits won't materialize during their term.
2. **Need for Short-Term Results:** With the shrinking executive tenure, businesses need to ensure the return on investments in transformation initiatives is realized in the short term. This way, current executives can witness the benefits of their decisions, fostering increased buy-in for future transformational efforts.
3. **Democratization of Technology:** As technology becomes increasingly accessible and easy to use, barriers to entry in various industries are lowering. This can lead to increased competition and further necessitate quick and ongoing change within organizations.
4. **Ongoing Transformation:** Transformations should no longer be seen as finite projects with a clear start and end point. Instead, they should be considered continuous processes, with the business constantly evolving and adapting to stay competitive.
5. **Value Delivery Regularity:** To ensure engagement and drive success, organizations should aim to deliver value on a regular basis. Proposing a regularity of every ninety days aligns with most quarterly business cycles, enabling executives to see the fruits of their decisions within their tenure.
6. **Avoiding Long-Term Mega Projects:** As transformation becomes a constant process, businesses should steer away from massive, multi-year projects. These can often be delayed, over budget, or less effective due to changing business environments. Small, frequent changes can provide more flexibility and responsiveness.
7. **Agility in Transformation:** Traditional methods of project execution may no longer suffice in this dynamic landscape. Businesses should adopt agile principles, where changes are implemented in small, manageable chunks, enabling faster delivery, feedback collection, and adjustment. This approach can provide regular opportunities for celebrating small wins and keeping teams motivated.
