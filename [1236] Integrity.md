# [1236] Integrity

In today's fast-paced business world, integrity is often seen as a luxury rather than a necessity. Senior management, company targets, and investor/shareholder expectations can create a pressure to bend the rules and play less than fair. However, it always pays to have and display integrity.

Integrity should be at the core of your wider purpose and personal brand. Leading with clear principles helps build respect, personal brand, greater buy-in, and more dynamic and coherent teams. Good things come to good people, so take responsibility for your actions. If you handle difficult issues with agility and integrity, rewards will follow.

Culture always comes from the top. Founders and senior executives set the tempo and the guard rails for behaviors expected and tolerated within an organization. As a leader, it's your responsibility to set the tone for the rest of the team. By demonstrating integrity in your actions and decision-making, you inspire others to do the same.

Remember, integrity is not just a buzzword. It's the key to success in business and in life. So, lead with clear principles, take responsibility for your actions, and set the tempo and guard rails for behaviors. With integrity as your guide, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.
