# [1221] Leadership

As a CTO, it is not enough to simply be responsible for the outcomes or results of a project. True leadership requires a deep sense of accountability that goes beyond the surface level.

You must be willing to take charge and make decisions that will drive your team forward. The buck stops with you, and you must be willing to accept the responsibility that comes with it. Your focus should be on achieving results and making things happen, no matter the obstacles that may arise.

True leadership requires a visceral connection with your company and the people you work with. Be passionate about what you do, and let that passion drive you towards success, while maintaining a strong sense of ethos and ethics.

### Evolution

It's worth noting that leadership styles evolve over time, and as new leaders emerge, they often emulate the leadership style they have experienced in the past. This can perpetuate the command-and-control approach if it remains unchecked. By recognizing the shortcomings of outdated leadership styles and actively seeking to develop a more inclusive and adaptable approach, leaders can better navigate the complexities of the modern business world and drive their teams toward success.

### Criticism

Criticism is a natural part of leadership, but it is how you respond to it that truly matters. Accept it gracefully and use it to address any issues that may arise. As a leader, you must also create a pressure buffer for your team, helping them to stay focused and motivated even in the face of adversity.
