# [1244] Managing Your CEO

As a CTO it's important to understand the dynamics between the CEO and CTO. While it's true that every company is a tech company these days, it's important to remember that the CEO and CTO have different perspectives and priorities.

Managing the CEO can be a challenge, but it's also an opportunity to build a strong relationship and drive success for the company. By working collaboratively and communicating effectively, the CEO and CTO can build a strong partnership that drives innovation and growth. Remember, the CEO and CTO are both crucial to the success of the company. By understanding their perspectives and working together, you can help to create a culture of innovation and drive success for the company.

Remember, managing up is not about kissing up to your superior or fulfilling their needs above all else. Instead, it's about anticipating what will make your CEO's life easier and doing what's best for your company. It's about owning responsibility for not only what you manage but how you're managed. You are the advocate for your team and your technology, and you need to ensure that your CEO understands the details of your work.

Rapport and mutual respect are the foundation of any working relationship, and it's essential to establish this with your CEO. Spend time with them outside of the office, use humor appropriately, and always be truthful. Speak up if you disagree with something, but do it respectfully and provide clear and concise solutions. Customize your advice and solutions for your CEO, and always keep them in the loop about what's going on in your organization.

As a leader, you should never bring problems to the CEO without proposed solutions. And when it comes to the UI and UX, testing is the best way to resolve disagreements. If you lose the argument, do it their way, but always analyze if you still respect your CEO. If not, it may be time to move on.

Most importantly, always be sharing. Communication is key in any relationship, and it's especially important in the CTO/CEO relationship. Keep your CEO informed about what's going on in your organization, and never let them be surprised about any issues.

### Bilateral Meetings

Regular one-on-one meetings with the CEO are a great opportunity for you to showcase your digital strategy expertise and keep your CEO informed about the bigger picture.

These meetings are a chance for you to share your insights and ideas on how to achieve the company's long-term goals and vision. By keeping these meetings on a regular schedule, you can build a strong relationship with your CEO and develop a deep understanding of their vision.

Remember, these conversations can be incredibly insightful and can help you identify any changes that need to be made to your digital strategy in order to align with the company's long-term plans. So, use these meetings to your advantage and make sure you come prepared with high-level updates and pointed questions that will help you plan accordingly.
