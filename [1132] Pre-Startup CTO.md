# [1132] Pre-Startup CTO

If you're passionate about startups and want to make a difference, then this is the right field for you. With your expertise and guidance, you can help pre-startups turn their dreams into reality.

As a CTO, you have the opportunity to work with some of the most visionary and talented people in the industry. You'll encounter many pre-startups that are still in their early stages, with just a technologist and a founder trying to bring their vision to life.

The technologist is the backbone of the online company, coding tirelessly to keep up with the founder's vision. They are the CTO in name only, as they are often not paid much for their efforts. They cut corners to get something out, but once customers start paying, their focus needs to shift from product development to product growth. This includes worrying about keeping systems up, securing data, and growing a team, all while still trying to code.

It's not easy being a CTO in a pre-startup. They tend not to wish to give up control and feel threatened when they start to hire people, especially those who may be more qualified than they are. But with the right guidance and mentoring, they can be the right person to take the company to the next level.

As a pre-startup CTO, you can provide that guidance and mentoring. You can help pre-startups establish processes and structures that will enable them to scale their business. You can challenge and validate technical decisions, and help the CTO manage and maintain the system(s).
