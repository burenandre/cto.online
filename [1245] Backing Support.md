# [1245] Backing Support

As CTO you are bound to face tough decisions that may have a significant impact on your company. It's natural to feel overwhelmed and unsure about which path to take. However, it's essential to remember that you are not alone in this. Your CEO is there to support you and guide you through challenging times.

When faced with a tough decision, it's crucial to explore all your options and weigh the consequences of each path. But if you find yourself at a crossroads where there is no clear path to take, it's time to bring in the CEO. By doing so, you can share the burden of the decision and (re)gain a fresh perspective on the situation.

The CEO's role is not just to lead the company but also to support and guide the team through difficult times. They may bring new insights to the conversation that could help remove an impediment or provide a different perspective on the situation. This is the moment where you and the CEO become a team, working together to make the best decision for the company.
