# [1217] Your Vision

One of the key aspects of being CTO is to become a tech futurologist for the company and your colleagues. This means that you must start looking into the future and anticipate upcoming trends and opportunities. By doing so, you will be able to develop a strategic vision that will enable you to inspire key people and the wider team to buy into that vision.

Developing a strategic vision is a crucial pillar of any tech leadership and CTO role. It requires you to think critically about the future and to come up with innovative solutions that will help the company to stay ahead of the curve. However, equally critical is your ability to communicate that vision across the company in language that resonates for all stakeholders, technologists, and non-technologists alike.

### Vision Statement

When crafting your vision statement, it is important to consider two different audiences: the business and your own team. The business wants to know what your vision means for them, and your own team wants to hear the details of how it will be achieved.

Your vision statement should be inspiring, aspirational, and should define what your organization will be capable of achieving once it is realized. Keep your vision statement realistic and achievable within a three to five year timeframe.

As a leader, it is your responsibility to ensure that your vision statement is communicated effectively to your team and that they understand how their work contributes to the overall goal. Your vision should be a source of inspiration and motivation for your team, and it should drive them to work towards a common goal.

### What & Why

The first thing we need to understand is the "what" and "why" of your vision statement. Your vision statement is not just a simple statement of your project goals or technical debt. It is a powerful message that speaks to the heart of your business, your clients, and your investors. It should be able to give them a clear understanding of the benefits they will get from your vision.

Your vision statement should be straightforward, easy to understand, and relatable. It should be something that everyone in your organization can internalize and see how it will help them.

### How

As you and your team make decisions, always ask yourselves whether each choice takes you one step closer or one step farther away from your vision. This will keep you on track and ensure that every action you take is in support of your ultimate goal.

Your vision should be exciting and inspiring for your team. It should be something they can get behind and rally around. To test your team's commitment, ask them if they believe in your vision. If they don't, it's time to re-evaluate and make sure you're on the right track.

### Define Success

Without a vision, you're like a captain without a destination, sailing aimlessly without any direction or purpose. That's why it's essential to define your vision and set smaller milestones that lead you towards it. Each milestone achieved is a small win and should be celebrated with your team, motivating them to keep pushing forward.

It's not enough to have a vision. You need to define what success looks like for your company, so everyone is on the same page. It's common for CTOs to speak in generalities with wide-ranging statements, but that can lead to confusion and disagreements. By firming up your success criteria, you eliminate any disputes when you reach your goals.

### Communication

Communicating your vision is essential to ensure that everyone is on board with your plans. You must be able to articulate your ideas clearly and concisely, using language that is easy to understand. By doing so, you will be able to inspire your colleagues and motivate them to work towards a common goal.
