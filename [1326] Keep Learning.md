# [1326] Keep Learning

Every day brings new challenges, new opportunities, and new technologies to explore. And in this ever-changing landscape, the key to success is education and training.

Keeping up with the latest trends, tools, and processes is not just a want, but a necessity. And as leaders of our teams, it is up to us to ensure that our colleagues are educated and trained to the highest standards, not only for their own personal growth but also for the benefit of our clients.

To make time for learning, it's important to create space in your schedule. This could mean setting aside a specific time each day or week to read and learn, or it could mean carving out uninterrupted blocks of time where you can focus on learning without distractions.

Gone are the days of expensive, formal classroom-style training programs. Today, we have access to a wealth of online resources, including material from top-rated universities, online libraries, and specialized sites that offer formal online-class-style courses. All for free.

But beyond the practical benefits of education and training, there is something more profound at work here. When we invest in ourselves and our colleagues, we are not just improving productivity and keeping our platforms modern. We are also gaining self-worth and self-esteem, and we are becoming better versions of ourselves.

### Keep Asking

Asking questions is an essential part of growth and development, both personally and professionally. It's natural to feel uncomfortable or nervous about asking questions, but it's important to remember that it's not a sign of weakness. In fact, it's a sign of strength and confidence to admit when you don't know something and seek out answers.

Surround yourself with talented individuals who have different areas of expertise and knowledge. Embrace the fact that they may know more than you in certain areas, and encourage them to share their insights and ideas. After all, that's why you hired them in the first place!

In board meetings or other professional settings, don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions. Challenging the status quo and speaking your mind can lead to better decision-making and ultimately, better outcomes. There are likely others in the room who are unsure or have questions as well.

It's essential to prioritize continuous learning in order to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate the future. By reading widely and creating space for learning, you can gain valuable insights and stay informed about the latest trends and developments in your industry. And by disconnecting from technology and taking time to recharge, you can ensure that you have the energy and focus to tackle the bigger strategic questions that lie ahead.

### Stay Foolish

Have a growth mindset. Be constantly curious and open to learning. Don't fall into the trap of a fixed mindset, where you believe you know everything and are resistant to change or new ideas. Embrace the unknown and seek out new knowledge and experiences. Stay foolish.
