# [1215] Elevator Pitch

The elevator pitch is a powerful tool that can help you communicate your vision and ideas effectively. It is a short description that can be explained in 30 seconds or less, allowing you to quickly and easily convey your vision to anyone you meet. A great elevator pitch can help you win over investors, inspire your team, and create a buzz around your company.

But crafting a great elevator pitch takes practice and skill. You need to distill your ideas down to their essence, and present them in a way that is both compelling and easy to understand. You need to know your audience, and tailor your pitch to their needs and interests. And most importantly, you need to believe in your vision and convey that passion to others.

By following a structured approach, you can create a pitch that is both technical and business-oriented. Start by identifying the benefits of your vision for either employees or clients, followed by the internal features of your vision. Take a break and let your brain process these items while you sleep, then remove any repeated or implied items to get down to a list of 5 to 7 items.

Rank these items in order of importance from a business perspective. For each of the items, create a technical sentence and a non-technical sentence that is free of buzzwords or jargon. Finally, find the opener, the grabber, that engages the listener and has them excited to listen to you for the next 20 seconds as you run down your list.

The key to a successful pitch is to engage your audience and get them excited about your idea. The more you practice, the more familiar the words will sound coming out of your mouth, and you'll find subtly different ways of saying the same thing as you read the body language of the person standing in front of you.
