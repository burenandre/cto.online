# [1234] Behavioral Change

It's essential to understand that a transformation is not just about implementing new processes or technologies. It's about changing the way people think and act.

The most challenging and critical factor in a successful transformation is behavior change. As the transformation hero of the company, it's your responsibility to lead by example and create a culture of inclusivity and transparency. Embracing a fail-fast philosophy and collaborating with other initiative owners can help you navigate the challenges that come your way.

At the individual level, change can be even more challenging.

### Biases

We all have our biases and tendencies that can hinder our ability to adapt to new ways of doing things. However, it's crucial to recognize these behavioral norms and work to overcome them. Whether it's status quo bias, intention-action gap, or loss aversion, we can all learn to embrace change and step out of our comfort zones.

### Transparency

Transparency is also key to ensuring that everyone is aligned with the main transformation objectives. It is important to promote visibility throughout the organization, even at the lower levels, through dashboards, checklists, and personal check-ins.

### Accountability

Each individual in the organization must be responsible for their expected behaviors throughout the transformation. Consequences are crucial to keeping the transformation on track. These can be positive or negative, but they must be targeted and effective in responding to unmet goals or underperforming staff.
