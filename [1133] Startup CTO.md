# [1133] Startup CTO

As a CTO in a startup company, you have a tremendous opportunity to shape the technological direction of the organization. You are responsible for leading your team, setting goals and objectives, and managing personnel. Most importantly, you have the power to foster a culture of innovation and creativity within your company.

### Pioneering

Stay abreast of new technologies and trends, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and create an environment where employees feel comfortable taking risks and experimenting without fear of failure. You must also be able to balance the business and technical requirements of the company, set and achieve short-term goals, and identify and analyze the risks associated with new technologies and products.

### Critical Decisions

A Startup CTO has the honor to make fundamental decisions for the company. (Un)fortunately many of those can make or break a startup company in the first couple of years. Especially in the online industry. Here are some common mistakes (too) early Startup CTO's tend to make:

- Failing to establish clear technology goals and objectives early on
- Failing to properly vet and select the right technology partner
- Over-relying on a single technology solution or platform
- Failing to invest in the right technology infrastructure and tools
- Neglecting to create a robust and secure technology environment
- Failing to keep up with the latest technology trends and developments
- Inadequate curation and assessment of potential big data values
- Not leveraging (early) customer reviews enough.

### Guidance

Being a Startup CTO is a crazy job, but how fulfilling if you aspire to make impact.

Here some advice.

1. Plan your work and work your plan.
