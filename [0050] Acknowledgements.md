# [0050] Acknowledgements

The initial drafts of this book have passed through multiple hands and undergone several revisions. Each revision provided me with invaluable feedback from the following collaborators. Their contributions enabled me to include additional concepts, refine ideas, increase my focus, and add clarity.

Without their support, this work wouldnâ€™t have evolved into the book you are now reading.
