# [1311] Personal Qualities

A great CTO has a vision that can be communicated and actioned. They are no different from any other leader in business in that they need to have the same skills to motivate and inspire to get the best out of their team. It is important to remember that this is not the only book you should be reaching for as you aspire to be better in your roleâ€”your shelf should contain at least one or two general leadership books.

A great CTO looks far down the road before making any decisions and communicates in a way that is confident yet non-patronizing. They listen to their CEO and board to understand their desires and goals and keep themselves updated with the technologies that are most relevant to their company's industry.

A CTO is not scared to fail and, should they fail, they refuse to point the finger. They don't try to do everything themselves and instead delegate to their team. They know they are not the smartest person in their team just because they are the boss, and they are confident to acknowledge and credit a good idea, irrespective of its source.

Generally speaking a CTO needs to master the following competences:

1. **Creative problem-solving abilities:** A good CTO is able to develop effective, efficient, and cost-efficient technology solutions for customers.
2. **Visionary:** The role of CTO requires a forward-thinking approach, with the ability to identify and plan for future technology needs.
3. **Ownership:** Ultimately responsible for defining which technology is used within an organization, the CTO must be willing and able to take ownership of those decisions.
4. **Motivation:** The CTO should have a passion for technology and be driven to see their organization succeed through its use.
5. **Patience:** Recognizing that technology takes time, the CTO must be patient in properly planning and executing technology solutions.
6. **Communication:** Effective communication is key to developing successful technology solutions and conveying important information to employees.
7. **Problem-solving skills:** The CTO must possess strong problem-solving skills in order to develop solutions that are effective for the organization, its employees, and its customers.
