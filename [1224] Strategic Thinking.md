# [1224] Strategic Thinking

Develop a strategic thinking approach.  'Seeing' the big picture is an essential skill for engineers, business leaders, and anyone who wants to make better decisions and solve complex problems. By practicing systems thinking, being open to new ideas, and staying curious, you can cultivate your big-picture thinking skills and become a better problem solver.

Big-picture thinking is the willingness to look at things from different angles and consider new viewpoints. Is the ability to see how all the pieces fit together and understand the broader perspective of a situation. This applies looking at problems from a holistic perspective, considering the interconnections between different parts of a system and seeing how they work together.

Use mind mapping and visualization techniques. These tools can help you see the big picture by mapping out concepts and connections in a visual format. Cultivate curiosity. Big-picture thinking requires a deep curiosity about the world and a desire to understand how things work. Stay curious, remain open to learning, and always ask questions.
