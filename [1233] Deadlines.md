# [1233] Deadlines

You understand that missed deadlines can be frustrating and can have a significant impact on the success of your business.

It's important to identify the root cause of missed deadlines and not simply place blame on the technology team. Incomplete specifications, starting development before fully understanding the business needs, and dependencies on other teams can all contribute to missed deadlines. However, with clear communication and a proactive approach, we can overcome these challenges and deliver projects on time.

As your business grows, it's crucial to manage expectations and communicate achievable deadlines to the rest of the organization. This is particularly important when working with third-party suppliers, as it's essential to understand their development processes and reliability.

Work together to identify potential roadblocks and proactively address them before they become a problem. By taking a proactive approach, you can ensure that deadlines are met, and your business can continue to grow and thrive. Remember, we're in this together, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
