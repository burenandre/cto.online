# [1120] CTO Personalities

CTO are not created equal. There are several different personas that you might encounter, each with their own unique approach to the role.

Here are six of the most common types of CTO:

- **The Innovator:** this person is always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible. They are constantly seeking out new technologies and approaches that can be incorporated into their work.
- **The Organizer:** this persona is all about structure and efficiency. They excel at organizing teams and projects and are often the go-to person when it comes to creating detailed plans and timelines.
- **The People Person:** This Head of Engineering is highly skilled in interpersonal communication and often serves as a bridge between the engineering team and other parts of the organization. They are adept at managing conflicts and building strong relationships with stakeholders.
- **The Big Picture Thinker:** this persona is focused on the long-term vision for the organization. They are skilled at developing and implementing strategic plans that align with the company's overall goals and objectives.
- **The Mentor:** this Head of Engineering takes a hands-on approach to leadership and is dedicated to developing the skills and capabilities of their team members. They are highly invested in the growth and success of their team.
- **The Problem Solver:** this persona is highly skilled at identifying problems and implementing solutions. They are often called upon to lead crisis management efforts and are highly valued for their ability to think on their feet.

With these different personas in mind, it's clear that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to being a successful CTO. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each type, you can better recognize which characteristics are most important for your organization and work to cultivate those qualities in your own leadership style.
