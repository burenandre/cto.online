# [1235] Stage-Gate Programs

It's essential to have a structured and uniform approach to managing large and complex transformations.

The stage-gate program is an effective methodology that ensures all initiatives and projects operate on a level playing field. It provides a vetting process that prioritizes initiatives, rigorously evaluates ROI, and ensures smart execution plans with clear milestones before any project moves into execution.

One of the significant benefits of the stage-gate process is that it creates transparency and focus during the execution phase. This phase puts projects into active weekly tracking and monitoring, ensuring that the targeted outcomes are achieved at the initiative, work-stream, and overall program levels.

To make the stage-gate methodology more effective, there are several best practices that companies can adopt. Successful initiatives or projects have well-thought-out milestones that incorporate some sort of financial impact. Companies that make disciplined use of milestones do better than projects without financial-impact milestones.
