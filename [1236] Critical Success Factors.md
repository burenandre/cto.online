# [1236] Critical Success Factors

Best practice is to assess the key success factors of your projects using a process called DICE. This process will help you zero in on four factors: the duration between crucial milestones, the integrity of the project team, the commitment of senior management and the broader team, and the effort that the project requires. By using DICE, you can determine whether a given project or initiative is currently set up for success or whether intervention is appropriate.

Beware of the following general factors that can make or break any digital transformation program.

- Having a clearly articulated case for change is essential to ensure everyone is on the same page and understands the why behind the transformation.
- A leadership team that is aligned on the what and how of the change is crucial to drive the transformation forward.
- A robust communications infrastructure is essential to keep everyone informed and engaged throughout the process.
