# [1216] First Principles Thinking

Use First Principles Thinking when creating your vision. This approach, borrowed from physics, is all about breaking things down in working backward from the source instead of reasoning from analogy.

Think therefore what your first-principles of your vision are. These are the core components that you need to rely on to support your vision's execution. By identifying your most foundational truth about your vision, you can focus on the implementation of your vision and ensure that you have a solid foundation to build upon.

As an example. Elon Musk's success story with Tesla cars is a classic example of how First Principles Thinking can revolutionize an industry. While everyone else was dismissing electric cars as too expensive, Elon asked the fundamental question, "Why didn't it work for them?" And he found the answer: the batteries were outrageously overpriced.

But instead of giving up, he dug deeper and discovered that the materials were cheap, and the costs to put batteries together were significantly less than what they were selling for. This presented an opportunity, and he seized it by buying the materials, building them himself, and launching Tesla.

First Principles Thinking can be applied to your vision too. By seeking the "why," we reveal the root of a problem or opportunity, and from there, we can see if everything adds up. If it does, ok, If not, there's usually an opportunity present.
