# [1331] CTO Succession

As a CTO, you have put in countless hours of hard work and dedication to get your team to where it is today. But at some point, you may find yourself in a position where you need to hand over the reins to someone new. Whether it's because you've outgrown the role or the company has been acquired, the way you pass on power will define your legacy with the organization.

### Reflecting On Yourself

Every decision you made as CTO was made with the best information you had at the time. As you prepare to pass on the torch, it's important to take a moment to reflect on your time in the role. While you may not have all the answers, the constraints you faced are valuable business knowledge that even the smartest CTO will not know. Share these insights with the incoming CTO and help them understand the context behind your decisions.

### Understanding Your Team

Your team is the backbone of your department, and it's important to ensure that the new CTO understands each team member's strengths and weaknesses. Going through each member of the team, highlighting their performance and areas of improvement, is a great place to start. However, it's important to keep the conversation focused on the areas that will help the new CTO understand their team from day one.

### Sharing Your Vision

Your vision for the department is steeped in years of in-depth business knowledge and experience. Even if you won't be there to see it through, it's important to share your vision with the incoming CTO. This insight is crucial for the new CTO, who will not have any of that context.

### Holistic View

In addition to the technical knowledge transfer, it's important to give the new CTO a holistic view of the issues that you have dealt with. Go through your calendar and talk about the recurring meetings and the meetings with those outside of your department. By going over the content and outcome of each meeting, you are giving the new CTO a head start with ongoing initiatives or issues.

### Leaving on a High Note

Always aim to  leave in good standing. Think of the team you are leaving behind, hoping they will be well taken care of and will have the opportunity to learn. You are setting them up to succeed by preparing the new CTO. As you pass on the torch, take pride in what you have accomplished and look forward to the next chapter in your career.
