Career planning is not just about setting a salary target or waiting for opportunities to come knocking on your door. It's about identifying your passions, desires, and making a plan to achieve them.

When you wake up in the morning, what excites you? What drives you to be the best version of yourself? These are the questions that will help you discover your dream role. But, it doesn't stop there. You need to have a plan to achieve your goals, and that requires hard work, preparation, and planning.

As you embark on a journey towards becoming a next CTO, it's essential to define what success looks like for you. Success is not just about achieving your goals; it's about being happy and satisfied with the progress you've made. Take stock of your career journey so far and celebrate your achievements. Reflect on the major decisions you've made to get where you are today.

You are the only one responsible for your success. It's up to you to make the most of this opportunity and open up new horizons for yourself. Dream big, plan bigger, and never stop working towards your goals. With hard work, preparation, and planning, you can achieve anything you set your mind to in your career.
